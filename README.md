# Versa

Versa allows users to dynamically annotate uploaded songs and view annotations.

## Using Versa

Versa is simple to use. Once logged in, users can annotate songs simply by highlighting text. Once text is highlighted, an annotate button appears, allowing the user to attach an annotation to the specified text.
